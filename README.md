Welcome to the github page for Looking Glass!

Looking Glass is an augmented reality tour of Ithaca College, which is intended to let 
prospective students get a feel for the campus without getting frustrated by not 
knowing their way around. It was created as as entry for the Ithaca College App Competition
and was placed 2nd.

Looking Glass is being actively developed by Jason Debottis, Adeesha Ekanayake, William Gelder and JP Heroux.
